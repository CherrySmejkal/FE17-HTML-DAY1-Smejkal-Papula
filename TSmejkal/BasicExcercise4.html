      <i><strong> The Shawshank Redemption </i> </strong> is a 1994 American drama film written
      and directed by Frank Darabont, based on the 1982 Stephen King novella
      Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. It tells the story of banker <em>Andy
      Dufresne</em> (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000209/">Tim Robbins</a>), who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State
      Penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims
      of innocence. Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow
      prisoner, contraband smuggler <em> Ellis "Red" Redding </em> (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000151/">Morgan Freeman</a>), and
      becomes instrumental in a money-laundering operation led by the prison
      warden <em>Samuel Norton</em> (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0348409/">Bob Gunton</a>). <em> William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil
      Bellows, and James Whitmore </em> appear in supporting roles.
