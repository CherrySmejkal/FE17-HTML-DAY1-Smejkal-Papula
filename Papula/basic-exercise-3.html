    <h3>Paint it Black</h3>
        <p>I see a red door<br>
           And I want it painted black<br>
           No colors anymore<br>
           I want them to turn black</p>
        <p>I see the girls walk by<br>
           Dressed in their summer clothes<br>
           I have to turn my head<br>
           Until my darkness goes</p>
        <p>I see a line of cars<br>
           And they're all painted black<br>
           With flowers and my love<br>
           Both never to come back</p>
        <p>I see a line of cars<br>
           And they're all painted black<br>
           With flowers and my love<br>
           Both never to come back</p>
        <p>I've seen people turn their heads<br>
           And quickly look away<br>
           Like a newborn baby<br>
           It just happens everyday</p>
        <p>I look inside myself<br>
           And see my heart is black<br>
           I see my red door<br>
           I must have it painted black</p>
        <p>Maybe then, I'll fade away<br>
           And not have to face the facts<br>
           It's not easy facing up<br>
           When your whole world is black</p>
        <p>No more will my green sea<br>
           Go turn a deeper blue<br>
           I could not foresee this thing<br>
           Happening to you</p>
        <p>If I look hard enough<br>
           Into the setting sun<br>
           My love will laugh with me<br>
           Before the morning comes</p>
        <p>I see a red door<br>
           And I want it painted black<br>
           No colors anymore<br>
           I want them to turn black</p>
        <p>I see the girls walk by<br>
           Dressed in their summer clothes<br>
           I have to turn my head<br>
           Until my darkness goes</p>
        <p>I wanna see it painted<br>
           Painted black<br>
           Black as night<br>
           Black as coal</p>
        <p>I wanna see the sun<br>
           Blotted out from the sky<br>
           I wanna see it painted, painted, painted<br>
           Painted black, yeah</p>
