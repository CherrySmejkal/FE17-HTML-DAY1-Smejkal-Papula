                There’s also something to be
                said about this quote from the
                Dutch writer, Geert Mak –
                ‘Without coffeehouse there is
                no Vienna. Without Vienna,
                there is no coffeehouses.’ This
                is so true. The city’s soul has
                lived, and been brought to life
                and hotly discussed, in these
                holy places that serve coffee
                for many, many years. This
                would partly explain why their
                timeless charm survives today,
                making them just as beloved
                as they were when famous
                artists that are now printed on
                t-shirts once sat in their
                booths.

                with imperial ceremonial
                rooms and magnificent
